# heat_pump_validation
With the modules and functions in this repository the [compression heat pump and chiller](https://oemof-thermal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compression_heat_pumps_and_chillers.html) of oemof-thermal was validated.

#### Please note: 
As the original data, which has originally been used for the validation, has not been published, yet,
dummy data has been provided. It is located in the directory `/raw_data`. Running the scripts will generate results in the directory
`/results`.

The modules`validation_data_upm.py` and `graph_compressor_fan.py` are meant for internal use only, which is why they do not work with the dummy data provided.

#### Results
You can find the full results of the validation in the [documentation](https://oemof-thermal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/validation_compression_heat_pumps_and_chillers.html) of oemof-thermal.
